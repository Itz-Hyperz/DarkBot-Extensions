# Languages
Below you will find a simple documentation article on custom languages within Dark Bot 1.3!

### Default Language
The default language in the config file is what will mainly be used within the bot, it is what the commands will be loaded as, and also what the bot will use by default each time it joins a guild. Setting this specific config option is crucial and will be primarily what your bot reads everything through by default.

Below you will find your options for this file.

- `english`
- `spanish`
- `german`
- `polish`
- `korean`
- `danish`
