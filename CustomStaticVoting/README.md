# CustomStaticVoting
I literally only wrote this extension for the Discord I have with my IRL friends. This makes the server a total meme every time we get on Discord and it's great. I don't recommend using this in a large community server, or a server that you really care about very much. It's all for fun and this gives more opportunity for people to have a real say in the server itself without creating their own.

# Commands

```
vote!servername [NEW NAME]
vote!servericon [IMAGE URL]
